DUET - A Simple Poetry Generator
by Sagan Yee

This Python script takes two text files and randomly interleaves lines from each to create something resembling a poem. You can change parameters such as where line breaks happen, how long the poem is, and what happens with punctuation.

Created for the School for Poetic Computation's 2022 Scrapism course.
