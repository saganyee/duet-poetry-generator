Peerless natural beauty? I’ve always found it annoying. If you’re staying at the Banff Springs Hotel or Chateau Lake Louise, there’s no getting away from it: everywhere you look they put a view in front of your nose. When you turn your head in hopes of finding something dreary to soothe those dazzled eyes, it happens yet again. In the frame of a pleasant Romanesque window, some inconsiderate genius has placed, with sensitivity, a perfect mountain. Or a valley dark with conifers. It can wear you down. Thus I found myself repairing to the steam tunnels, those warm, slimy underground passages that lace the foundations of the old hotels. And it was there by chance that I met a class of human being rarely encountered by the pampered guest: a small society that hardly sees the light of day, that has its own customs, politics, and mythology.
